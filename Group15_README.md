## Installation and Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

To get started, first install the required dependencies by running the following command in your project root directory:

bash
npm install


This will install all necessary packages for both the frontend and backend.

### 2. Running the Frontend

Once the dependencies are installed, navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
cd frontend


Now, run the frontend application using the following command:

bash
npm run dev


This will start the frontend of the website, and you can view it at http://localhost:5173.

### 3. Running the Backend

Next, go to the backend directory:

bash
cd backend


Now, run the backend application:

bash
npm run dev


This will start the backend, and it will be running on http://localhost:5000.

### 4. Final Steps
